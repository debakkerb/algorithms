# Algorithms

Open source repository with data structures and algorithms.  This is a work in progress, so if you are interested, be sure to check back regularly for updates. Because of this, you will probably see errors or inconsistencies in some of the implemented structures. 

## Run
If you want to run the tests, execute `make` in the top level directory.  This runs `mvn clean test`.
